very fast install to see result time
i.e. 
npm i
run some cli command (qur-docs) to compile docs 
AND start server 
AND open browser
AND show the result in browser
(like `parcel` command)
to compile docs use `qur-docs --production`
to publish docs to qur-hub use `qur-docs --production --publish` 
OR if already compiled `qur-docs --publish`
run prompt:
please select the name under which you want to publish (if published before than this will not be shown)
You can change name later. You will also be able to: 
- bind your custom domain. 
- bind your remote backend (QurBackend) with docs.  (adds link in remote backend, no matter if private or public)
docs.qurhub.com/ <cursor here>



MONETIZATION:



IDEA IDEA IDEA: easy buy domains with command-line?
- for docs
- for backends/db
QurDomains.
e.g.
> qur-domains whois mydomain.com (just for convenience, getting whois is not a problem at all)
> qur-domains buy mydomain.com
> prompt asking contact details if there are no any
> prompt that not enough money on account if it is the case
> [if one card exist] do you want to use card 1234-****-****-5678
> [if multiple cards exist] please chose payment card
1234-****-****-5678
4321-****-****-5678
5667-****-****-5678
9876-****-****-5678
> "do you want to"



IDEA
CLI-processing
QurPayments
probably firstly should be fully-open-source
what can it do?
payments via CLI (enter card in CLI)
who can use
tech guys who want pay fast
for what can they use it?
for saas services like QurDomain (quickly buy domain)
what else can be bought other than domains?
- SSL certificates
- tech saas user subscriptions, volumes (e.g. storage GB) etc.
how can they use?
- install npm library to their CLI command
- the livrary makes:
-- prompts, collects card numbers

-- probably encryption
All traffic MUST go through SSL (https)
What else for security? 
(security MUST be considered VERY strongly because one fault can 
drop reputation for years (but maybe bad PR is also PR so consider not over-efforting)https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/53596/how-safe-is-ssl
