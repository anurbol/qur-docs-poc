very fast install to see result time
i.e. 
npm i
run some cli command (qur-docs) to compile docs 
AND start server 
AND open browser
AND show the result in browser
(like `parcel` command)
to compile docs use `qur-docs --production`
to publish docs to qur-hub use `qur-docs --production --publish` 
OR if already compiled `qur-docs --publish`
run prompt:
please select the name under which you want to publish (if published before than this will not be shown)
You can change name later. You will also be able to: 
- bind your custom domain. 
- bind your remote backend (QurBackend) with docs.  (adds link in remote backend, even if either private or public)
docs.qurhub.com/ <cursor here>
THINK: there will be repos on qurhub.com
