Goal: very fast install to see result time
i.e. 
npm i
run some cli command (qur-docs) to compile docs 
AND start server 
AND open browser
AND show the result in browser
(like `parcel` command)
to compile docs use `qur-docs --production`
to publish docs to qur-hub use `qur-docs --production --publish` 
OR if already compiled `qur-docs --publish`
run prompt:
please select the name under which you want to publish (if published before than this will not be shown)
You can change name later. You will also be able to: 
- bind your custom domain. 
- bind your remote backend (QurBackend) with docs.  (adds link in remote backend, no matter if private or public)
docs.qurhub.com/ <cursor here>




MONETIZATION:
- traffic based? [most probably, allows free dev-period and paid production period]
- user based? [nah, bad idea. Probablythe only user would always be CI platform (e.g. gitlab)]
LIKE ALL OTHER GOOD SOFTWARE QURDOCS IS FREE FOR OSS AND PAID FOR PRIVATE DOCS






GENERAL ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
one const = one page
const may contain markdown
name of const is page's name
page is rendered html file
- 


# FLOW
- iterate consts
render html outputs per each const
save to disk
publish (when cli command is ran)



render flow:
firstly const must be converted to 
markdown string:
- with ts compiler iterate through doc folder. 
visit every file
in each file visit every constant
in that constant replace 
codeBlock(() => {...})
with 
```ts (js for js file)

```
then pass it to md.render()
then create file {const name}.html in doc/dist file (configurable)
then publish
QUESTIONS:
how to do example + test?
how to do sandbox feature?
what if example does not work in isolation?
e.g. we want to show only side-effect without action and the entire state
...
return () => {
    someSideEffectFn()
}
...
e.g. we want to show only action without the entire state
...
setUser(user) {
    this.user = user
}
...
then just write them out as simple text (inside ` quotes)





MISC
`const bar = "...";const foo = bar` is how alias can be made



ADD TO README:
Contribution wanted: 
JSM (Javascript Markdown) syntax highlighing
- in VS Code





IDEA: combine examples with tests
i.e. example must produce some expected result
e.g. 
const foo = `some description


` todo




READING RAW DOCS (.ts files must be as easy as reading compiled HTML docs)




.JS FILES MUST BE SUPPORTED





AUTO-GENERATE TABLE OF CONTENTS IN RIGHT SIDEBAR 
like in gitbook and in cypress.io docs
each ## heading generates new link
like here https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-table-of-contents






IS IT POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT OTHER LANGUAGES? HOW?




each example block (codeBlock) should:
- have tests
- be editable at stackblitz or other
- probably show result of each expression (popover)







PAGE representation, possible options: 
1. const
- bad - badly structured
- bad - not shrinkable/expandable
- good - laconic
- good - laconic alias syntax
good - easier refactoring

2. pages({
    "some page": ``
})
good - whitespaces in page title allowed
good - ability to use consts
good - no "how it works" confusion
good - no need to make tslint rules exceptions (variable-name)
bad - page title is hardly distinguishable from it's text




IDEA: codeblocks' text can be extracted even with js someCodeBlock.toString()
without typescript compiler. But is it enough?
I guess no, because typescript compiler can:
- get information about types
- traverse code






trim whitespaces of articles because frequent pattern will probably be `
like this
`



Not only guarantee link to articles are not broken
but also link to anchors are not broken:
pages(
    {
        "page"
    }
)



Not only show example as static image,
but also show gif showing autocompletion
(but sandbox IDE (stackblitz) with autocomletion may make it unnecessary)






basic feature list: 
- codeBlocks
code is real
- link to articles
auto completion of articles' names
- link to articles' sections (#, ##, ###, etc.)
- links to other anchors? YES like this: 
"some page": {
    "Section 1": `...`, // with heading
    "_anchor": `...` // with heading
}
