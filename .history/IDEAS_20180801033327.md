Goal: very fast install to see result time
i.e. 
npm i
run some cli command (qur-docs) to compile docs 
AND start server 
AND open browser
AND show the result in browser
(like `parcel` command)
to compile docs use `qur-docs --production`
to publish docs to qur-hub use `qur-docs --production --publish` 
OR if already compiled `qur-docs --publish`
run prompt:
please select the name under which you want to publish (if published before than this will not be shown)
You can change name later. You will also be able to: 
- bind your custom domain. 
- bind your remote backend (QurBackend) with docs.  (adds link in remote backend, no matter if private or public)
docs.qurhub.com/ <cursor here>




MONETIZATION:
- traffic based? [most probably, allows free dev-period and paid production period]
- user based? [nah, bad idea. Probablythe only user would always be CI platform (e.g. gitlab)]
LIKE ALL OTHER GOOD SOFTWARE QURDOCS IS FREE FOR OSS AND PAID FOR PRIVATE DOCS






GENERAL ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
one const = one page
const may contain markdown
name of const is page's name
page is rendered html file
- 


# FLOW
- iterate consts
render html outputs per each const
save to disk
publish (when cli command is ran)



render flow:
firstly const must be converted to 
markdown string:
- with ts compiler iterate through doc folder. 
visit every file
in each file visit every constant
in that constant replace 
codeBlock(() => {...})
with 
```ts (js for js file)

```
then pass it to md.render()
then create file {const name}.html in doc/dist file (configurable)
then publish
QUESTIONS:
how to do example + test?
how to do sandbox feature?
what if example does not work in isolation?
e.g. we want to show only side-effect without action and the entire state
...
return () => {
    someSideEffectFn()
}
...
e.g. we want to show only action without the entire state
...
setUser(user) {
    this.user = user
}
...
then just write them out as simple text (inside ` quotes)





MISC
`const bar = "...";const foo = bar` is how alias can be made



ADD TO README:
Contribution wanted: 
JSM (Javascript Markdown) syntax highlighing
- in VS Code





IDEA: combine examples with tests
i.e. example must produce some expected result
e.g. 
const foo = `some description


` todo




READING RAW DOCS (.ts files must be as easy as reading compiled HTML docs)




.JS FILES MUST BE SUPPORTED





AUTO-GENERATE TABLE OF CONTENTS IN RIGHT SIDEBAR 
like in gitbook and in cypress.io docs
each ## heading generates new link
like here https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-table-of-contents






IS IT POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT OTHER LANGUAGES? HOW?




eacg example block should be
